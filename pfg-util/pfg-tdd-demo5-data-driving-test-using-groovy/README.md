In this module, we demo how to write test using spock and groovy.

Please note that:
    1. If you run UserServiceSpec in IDEA, please ensure mark /src/test/groovy as Test Sources Root.
    2. Run UserServiceSpec in IDEA or you can use maven command line.
    3. As you can see, groovy is much easier to write powerful test cases.
