We write several modules to demo how to test different layers of a Spring Boot Application.
We also demo how to write thoroughly failure/accuracy/stress tests and how to write data-driven tests with groovy.

1. pfg-tdd-demo1-test-service
2. pfg-tdd-demo2-test-controller
3. pfg-tdd-demo3-integration-test
4. pfg-tdd-demo4-how-to-test-thoroughly
5. pfg-tdd-demo5-data-driving-test-using-groovy


please note that, this is only for demo purpose.

In real situation, you need to trade off how to write different kinds of tests.
