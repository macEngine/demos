In this module, we demo how to test service layer.

Please note that:
    1. Run UserServiceTest in IDEA or you can use maven command line.
    2. During the test, UserEntityRepository is mocked, we only focus service layer.
    3. Mock DAO layer will speed up the test since there is no db connection.
